Through Google AdWords, I am going to reach my target audience of beginners in beauty. I decided on titling the ad "Glam Guide" to get their attention and then added "for beginners" to specifically cater to my market. Google AdWords made the most sense to use because most people turn to Google when searching for beauty tips and recommendations. The cost of my campaign is $5 a day and the location is focused in Miami, FL. The keywords I used are: cosmetics, for women, makeup, brows, foundation, lipstick, eyeshadow, tips, tutorial. I have an estimated performance of 1800-3047 impressions per month and 91-154 clicks per month.
